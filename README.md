# üß† AI Legal Case Analyzer

This project leverages AI models from [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) ‚Äî specifically **DeepSeek** and **GPT-4o-mini** ‚Äî to assist in analyzing legal case documents and image evidence. It performs two key functions:

- Summarizes a legal document (`case1.txt`) using **DeepSeek**.
- Analyzes an image (from a URL) using **GPT-4o-mini** to describe its content.
